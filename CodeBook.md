Code book for tidy_means_std_avg.txt
====================================

"subject"      
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

"activity"      
The activity the subject was performing. 

All the remaining variables are of the form: avg_(original measurement). Each represents the mean of the corresponding <original measurement> for this particular "subject" and "activity".

See the features_info.txt file that comes with the original dataset for more information on what each measurement means. The dataset can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Variables that have "_time" represent time domain measurements.
Variables with "_frequency" represent frequency domain measurements.
